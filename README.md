DESCRIPTION OF MY TASK 3 : For Task 3, I developed a fully interactive dashboard in Power BI using the Global Superstore dataset. The objective of this task was to build a visually compelling and insightful dashboard that enables users to explore sales performance across various dimensions such as region, product category, customer segment, and time. The process began with data transformation and cleaning, where I ensured that the dataset was accurate, complete, and consistent. This involved handling missing values, converting data types, renaming columns for clarity, and establishing relationships between tables. Once the data was properly structured, I loaded the refined dataset into Power BI for analysis and visualization.

The dashboard consists of multiple dynamic visuals, each designed to provide specific insights. To begin with, I created a pie chart that displays the sum of sales by customer segment, offering a quick snapshot of which customer types such as Consumer contribute the most to revenue. In addition, a donut chart breaks down sales by geographical region (East, West, Central, South), allowing users to compare regional performance at a glance. A funnel chart was used to represent the sum of sales across various product sub-categories, effectively illustrating the ranking and comparative volume of each sub-category.

A map visualization plots sales by both country and city, making it easy to identify regional sales concentrations across the globe. To provide product-level detail, a horizontal bar chart displays the sum of sales by product name, highlighting the top-selling products. A line plot shows the trend of sales over time, based on order dates, which helps in identifying patterns and seasonal fluctuations in sales performance.

To enrich the dashboard with customer-specific insights, I included a data table that lists customer names along with their region, sales figures, ship modes, and segments. This provides a granular view that is especially useful for sales representatives and business analysts. One of the key visualizations compares sales by product categories (Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology) on a monthly basis, which helps in identifying the best-performing categories during different times of the year.

The dashboard also includes KPI cards to display total sales and profit, offering an at a glance view of overall business performance. A half-donut chart was added to visually emphasize total sales in a more modern and engaging format. To enhance interactivity, I incorporated dropdown filters for month and year, based on the order date. These slicers allow users to filter the entire dashboard dynamically, enabling them to drill down into specific time periods and see how all metrics and visuals adjust accordingly.

Each visual element in the dashboard was carefully formatted for clarity, consistency, and ease of use. Colors were chosen to differentiate categories and segments clearly, and the layout was organized in a logical, user-friendly manner. Overall, the final dashboard presents a well-rounded, interactive, and visually appealing view of the Global Superstoreâ€™s sales data. It enables business users to uncover trends, identify growth opportunities, and make data-driven decisions with confidence.
